Assignment 2 - Data analysis

## Content
In this assignment, we're analyzing descriptive statistics and inferential statistics of the total screening time in adolescents and their well being scores by groups (Gender, Minority and Deprivation).
We also calculate Confidence Intervals and apply hypothesis testing ( T - test and Man-Whitney U test) to see the differences between groups in Screening time and Well being scores.
Last but not least, we're analyzing if there is any difference between the group that has low screening time and high screening time on their Well being scores.
